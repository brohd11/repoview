// Package doc ships repoview's user manual: the markdown pages in embedded/,
// compiled into the binary and browsed in-app via Actions ▸ Docs (the TUI adapter
// lives in internal/app/docs). The pages sit here — the repo's doc folder — rather
// than inside the app package so they're easy to find and edit; go:embed can't
// reach a parent directory, so the embed must live at this level.
//
// Adding a page is dropping a numbered .md into embedded/ — no code change. The
// filename orders it, the first "# " heading is its title, and the first line
// under that heading is its one-line description in the index.
